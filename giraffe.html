<h1>Giraffes</h1>
<img src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/cc_Giraffes_16x9.jpg?itok=dKmuVKO6" alt="Tiger" style="width:500px">
<p> Giraffes are found in the dry savannas of Africa, where they roam among the open plains and woodlands.Well known for their long necks, these gentle giants are the world’s tallest living land animals. An adult male can grow to around 5.5m – that’s taller than three adult humans!A giraffe’s height is helpful for keeping a look out for predators, such as lions and hyenas. Their excellent eyesight allows them to spot hungry beasts from far away, too.
Herbivores, giraffes only eat plants. Their favourite grub is the acacia tree, and they use their long necks to reach the leaves and buds in the treetops. Their long tongues (which grow to a whopping 53cm!) also help them pull down leaves growing way up high. </p>
